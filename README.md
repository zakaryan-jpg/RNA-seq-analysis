RNA-seq analysis using experiment from Expression Atlas.
The project was completed for the course of Bioinformatics I duirng the second semester of the second year of my Bachelor's studies.
Next Generation Sequencing identifying the dosage compensation state in human endometrial carcinoma and adjacent tissues. GEO: GSE56087
This differential experiment was done using RNA-seq technology by having 9 individuals with 36 samples, where 18 samples were the normal non-cancerous adjacent ones and the other 18 were the endometrial cancerous. Each individual had 2 samples takes from both tissues. 
The tissues were generated by Illumina 100-nucleotide paired-end sequencing. The main aim of the research was to understand if dosage compensation is completed properly in cancerous cell, or if some genes get over-activated in cancer tissue.
